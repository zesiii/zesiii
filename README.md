### Hi there! I'm Yuntian Zhang, currently a graduate student at QMSS, Columbia University, specializing in Data Science. ðŸ™Œ I'll be graduating in 12/2024.
ðŸ’« My passion lies in leveraging the power of data to derive business insights and inform strategic decision-making. I'm particularly interested in the crossroads of data and various industries, with a focus on technology and business.

ðŸ”› This semester, I'm studying Bayesian statistics, CNN and Visualization along with webpage building. 

ðŸš„ Currently looking for internship during 05/2024 - 08/2024 :)

### ðŸ”§ My Toolbox:
Python (scikit-learn; TensorFlow; keras; numpy; pandas) | R | MySQL | Tableau

Machine Learning | Deep Learning | Operations | Data Mining | Visualization | NLP | Prompt Engineering |

Business Insights | Finance | Platform Economics

### ðŸ“‚ Projects:
[Movie Production Chatbot via ChatGPT-3.5 Prompt Engineering](movie-production-chatbot) 
This is the capstone I worked on last semester, collaborating with KPMG Lighthouse.

We used few-shot prompting by adding context, roles and rules. Achieved 96% accuracy after iterative updates. Then built a machine learning model for box office prediction, involving preprocessing, feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and ensemble. The final model achieved an RMSE of 1.1.

Finally, we implemented similarity search to connect front-end with back-end using cosine similarity. Backend retrieves movies most similar to input from the database, feeds their features into the prediction model, and outputs predicted box office results and casting recommendation list on the UI.

You can input their movie script draft, and our chatbot will provide you with box office prediction, budget prediction and recommended casts. 

### ðŸ“¢ Contact:
Please connect with me! I'd love to meet new people in data field.
